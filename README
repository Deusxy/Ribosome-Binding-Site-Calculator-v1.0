This is a software implementation of the Ribosome Binding Site (RBS) Calculator.

The RBS Calculator can predict the translation initiation rate of a protein coding sequence in bacteria. It can also design synthetic ribosome binding site sequences to rationally control the protein expression level. It combines a thermodynamic model of ribosome and mRNA interactions with a sequence optimization algorithm. The RBS Calculator was developed by Howard Salis and Chris Voigt at UC San Francisco.


**  A New and Improved Version of the RBS Calculator Has Been Developed with Greater Predictive Accuracy and a User-Friendly Web Interface  **
The first round of improvements to the RBS Calculator model have been described in:  HM Salis, "The Ribosome Binding Site Calculator", Synthetic Biology: Methods for Building and Programming Life, 19
The second round of improvements to the RBS Calculator model have been described in:  AE Borujeni, AS Channarasappa, HM Salis, "Translation rate is controlled by coupled trade-offs between site accessibility, selective RNA unfolding and sliding at upstream standby sites", Nucleic Acid Research, 2013
A new design method, the RBS Library Calculator, for efficient pathway optimization has been described and validated in: I Farasat, M Kushwaha, J Collens, M Easterbrook, M Guido, HM Salis, "Efficient Search, Mapping, and Optimization of Multi-protein Genetic Systems in Diverse Bacteria", Molecular Systems Biology 10 (6), 2014
A new biophysical model of translational coupling in bacterial operons has been developed and validated in: T Tian, HM Salis, "A predictive biophysical model of translational coupling to coordinate and control protein expression in bacterial operons", Nucleic acids research 43 (14), 7137-7151, 2015 

Additional rounds of model improvements and new design methods for synthetic operons, synthetic riboswitches, synthetic genetic circuits, and optimal metabolic pathways are currently in the process of being published.
